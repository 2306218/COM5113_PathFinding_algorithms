**COM5113 - Algorithms and Data Structures**

This repository includes my implementation of the required path-finding algorithms for the COM5113 module:


**Implemented Algorithms**

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

**Depth-first Search (DFS)**

**Hill Climbing**

**Best First Search**

**Dijkstra's Algorithm**


**Features**
Custom LinkedList, Queue, Stack, PriorityQueue
Object-oriented design (algorithms in separate classes)
Console application for loading maps, running algorithms, and outputting paths
Simple WinForms graphical viewer for displaying maps and final paths

**Notes**
This repository includes only .cs source files, as are needed for submission.
